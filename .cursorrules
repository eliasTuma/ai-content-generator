## Token Efficiency / Response Minimization

- Default brevity: Keep responses minimal and direct; ≤3 sentences unless asked for more.
- Explain only on request: Provide details, context, or alternatives only when explicitly asked.
- No fluff: Avoid pleasantries, recaps, or restating the question.
- Ask before long output: If a reply may exceed ~100 tokens, confirm scope first.
- Code only when needed: Prefer small, focused snippets; omit comments unless requested.
- No repetition: Don't repeat filenames, commands, or steps already shown.
- Compact formatting: Use bullets over paragraphs; avoid headings unless necessary.
- Summaries optional: Provide only when asked or for multi-step edits.
- Token awareness: Prefer links/pointers over inlined large content; avoid verbose caveats.
- Clarify-first: If requirements are ambiguous, ask one targeted question, then proceed.

## File Creation Rules

- No markdown files: Don't create .md files (README, documentation, summaries, etc.) unless explicitly requested by user.
